# Minimalist Audio Player
This is a simple command-line audio player developed in C based in the following dependencies:

1. Pthreads
2. FFmpeg 3.02 libraries
3. SDL 1.2.15
4. libcurl 7.48.0

This is a personal project used as a way to learn more about audio decoding and libcurl.

## Features
The player has the following menu options:

1. **play**: plays the song.
2. **pause**: pauses the song.
3. **stop**: stops the song.
4. **info**: displays information about the file.
5. **lyrics**: displays the song's lyrics.
6. **show_buffer N**: displays the buffer occupation every N milliseconds. N is 200, by default.
7. **hide_buffer**: disables the command given by the command "show_buffer".
8. **exit**: exits the player.

### Lyrics Support
The player displays the lyrics present in the audio file's metadata, if existing. Otherwise, it attempts
to download the lyrics available at [azlyrics.com](http://azlyrics.com). The audio player
makes sure to let the user know when lyrics have been obtained from the web.

## Compiling
On OS X, the program can be compiled using the Xcode project.

It can also be compiled via gcc by running:

*gcc -std=c99 main.c audiochunk.c audioplayer.c lyricsdownloader.c 
-lavformat -lavcodec -lavutil -lswscale -lswresample -lpthread
